This is a simple To-Do List web app that I created using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The main purpose of this project is to manage daily tasks easily — we can add new tasks, edit them, delete them, and mark them as complete.
I have also added a small motivational twist to make the app more interesting.  
Whenever a task is completed, the background gives a light color change and a random motivational quote appears on the screen.
The app also shows the total number of tasks and how many are completed, so users can see their progress at any time.  
All the tasks are saved automatically in the browser using localStorage, so even after refreshing the page, the data stays safe.
This project was made as part of a basic level assignment using simple JavaScript — no frameworks or external libraries were used.
